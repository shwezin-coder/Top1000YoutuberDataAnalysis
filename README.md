# Top 1000 YouTuber Analysis Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my analysis of the Top 1000 YouTuber Challenge by Onyx! This project dives into comprehensive insights across four key categories: Popularity, Last 30 Days data, Earnings, and Rankings.

### Categories:

1. **Popularity:** Subscriber count, population, and video views.
2. **Last 30 Days Data:** Subscribers and video views.
3. **Earnings:** Highest/lowest monthly and yearly earnings.
4. **Rankings:** Overall, country, channel type, and video view ranks.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Analysis

In the initial phase, I thoroughly examined the metadata within the dataset and established relationships among key elements. This laid the foundation for a robust analysis.

### 2. Visualization

Utilizing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and Power BI, I crafted visually insightful charts to represent the data trends. The README provides a guide on how to interpret these visualizations.

## Challenges and Solutions

One significant challenge was implementing charts based on a four-category filter. Particularly, retrieving the top 10 rankings for three categories while allowing for 1 to 10 rankings for countries, YouTubers, and channel types. This was successfully addressed using DAX subdivision functions and rank calculations with a switch case.
